# Deep Reinforcement Learning for the Mitigation of Gender Bias - A Thesis Project

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating reinforcement learning-based algorithms that may be used for the mitigation of gender bias in occupation prediction. The data cannot be published here, but the link to crawl it is supplied.

# Overview
The models can be trained using the notebook RL_gender_bias. In order to run it, change the path names to the location of the data and run all cells. 

# Thesis report
